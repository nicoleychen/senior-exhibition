    <h1><center><strong><em> Fighting Crime </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">I throw my head back laughing at something you say. You lean back in your chair, first surprised then pleased. My heart swells.

<p class="a">Love is ordinary, predictable. We all meet it one day, and it always feels bursting, flying, choking, exhilarating, exhausting, over. And when it is over, it becomes extraordinary so quickly. My memories never look the way I see things now. Last year looks vibrant and compressed, like a movie screen. Last month looks grainy, black and white. Yesterday looks like a sunset. Right now, today looks ordinary.

<p class="a">“Nicole?”

<p class="a">You ask me where I go when I space out like that. It’s hard to answer. Sometimes I am in my room with the shades drawn, broad daylight still peeking through. Sometimes I am colorless, breathing in dust and perfumes I’ve never smelled before. Today I was looking at your face, but not really.

<p class="a">Your left eye is slightly rounder than your right. Your right eyebrow sits slightly higher than your left. Your cheeks are faintly rosy, as they almost always are. The curves of your lips are soft and lovely. But still, it is hard to look at your face. My brain struggles to follow the slope of your nose as it meets your mouth. The space that meets your jaw and your chin is blurry, vaguely unfocused.

<p class="a">It is blurry in the same way that my best memories of you are: like a faded old photo in an album, only recognizable by the date and caption scrawled on the back. It is fond and intimate but unfamiliar. I want to vanish into that photograph of you — to crawl into each corner of your smile and to feel at home in the empty spaces on your face once again.

<p class="a">But we are here.

<p class="a">It should be a crime to lie about loving someone. That way, maybe we’d have a reason to stop saying it to each other.
