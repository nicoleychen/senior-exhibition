    <h1><center><strong><em> Apology </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">“I’m sorry, Alice.”

	<p class="a">She’s taken aback. An apology was the last thing she expected from him, but there it is, a simple confession so human it startles her. She says nothing in response.

	<p class="a">“I’m sorry about your mother. I’m sorry about what you’ve gone through. I really am.” He clears his throat, suddenly looking uneasy. “Alice, I came to ask you something. I know you’ve been living with your uncle, but, I was thinking, and…”

	<p class="a">I see his fingers twitching, and before Alice can stop him, his hand reaches for hers. Alice tenses, but she doesn’t pull away.
<p class="a">	“Alice, I want to make this right. You can say no, but… would you like to come live with me and Claire?”

	<p class="a">Claire. His new wife, and if she moved in, Alice’s stepmother. Alice can’t bear the thought, but still-
<p class="a">How could she stay with her uncle? Admittedly, things had gotten better. Even after their fight last year, Haley was kind to her, and protected her as best she could from her uncle.
	<p class="a">But she would never belong. And really, that’s all she wanted.

	<p class="a">“Okay.”

	<p class="a">He blinks. “Okay? As in, yes?”
	<p class="a">She averts her gaze, suddenly conscious of her decision. “Yeah.”
