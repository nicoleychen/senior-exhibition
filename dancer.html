    <h1><center><strong><em> Dancer </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">Lithe bodies, burnt bodies.
<p class="a">She watched the ballet dancers point their toes, extend their legs, lift their fingers. There was beauty there, sure, but she almost wished it was gone. The way they moved in unison— robotic, empiric, soldiers in line, marching to a lullaby.

<p class="a">There was something to be said about the girl in the front. She looked young; sixteen, seventeen, no older than eighteen. She was smaller than the others if you looked carefully, but her muscles gleaned finely in the thin light, and the graceful strength in her movements made everyone almost forget how damaged she was.

<p class="a">Look at her feet; bruised, knuckled, buckled together in a twisted croisé . Purpled with experience, swollen with effort. Tried, tried, and tried again, and pushed until pulled apart at the seams. The muscles in her face tighten with effort, and she holds her breath as she mimics the instructor. Look, look at how she doesn’t dare to breathe.
