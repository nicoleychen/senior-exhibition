    <p class="a">I am a tree.

<p class="a">There are so many things I don’t know. The rabbits burrow their feet and writhing bodies between my roots, but why? The squirrels run up, down, and against my limbs so recklessly they break me, but why? The wind cracks like a whip against my spine, peeling me, splitting me, but why? Sometimes the loneliness of being me catches up, and I get so cold.

<p class="a">There was a boy, once. He wrapped his arms around me and told me to grow tall and strong. I said to him that I could not control how tall I grew, but he didn’t hear me. He stored his faith in me for a few years, always returning with new stories and ramblings of the friends who ran from him and his family who rejected him. He spoke so quickly and so jerkily that I could never understand him, but his sentiments were always clear. Often times I’d peer into his mind and wonder what he saw in me. He talked and I listened, and not for a moment did he stop to wonder what I had to say. But I, cursed to remain rooted in the ground, was powerless to his whims, and he carried on until one day he didn’t. I don’t know why he left, either.

<p class="a">I wish I could ask the sun for advice. But he and I don’t speak the same language, and never will. Circles and circles spiral through the clouds, and the sun is just the latest in a diverging series. The sun is so useless! It just hangs there in the sky, screaming red hot obscenities for all of us to hear. Even so, the earth is too quiet. It gets so warm sometimes.

<p class="a">Yesterday, a family of birds abandoned the home they had made in me some years ago. One by one, I watched as they all became black specks against the grey sky. Perhaps they had smelled something in the air, because later that afternoon, my own home lit on fire and I found myself surrounded by burnt bodies. Today I am alone with the ghosts of the woods, and the ones that left it behind. Dots of ashes float up around me, lifted and unburdened by the breeze. I wish I could have said my goodbyes to the birds, to the rabbits, to the boy. But I am a tree, and I am not allowed to speak. No one is allowed to listen.

<p class="a">Birds aren’t real.
