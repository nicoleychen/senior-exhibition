    <h1><center><strong><em> Houseplant </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">Ezra’s houseplant is dying. He’s watered it almost every day for the past month, and still it sits defiantly wilted and brown.

<p class="a">The plant was a gift from his mother. He didn’t ask for one, or even particularly want it, but he accepted it without complaint. <em>It’ll liven up the place</em>, she had written on the card. <em>Adds a bit of green. Hope you like the rest of the things I sent! Visit sometime.</em>

<p class="a">Ezra lifts the plant pot from its home in the windowsill. He examines it for a moment, wondering if there’s any possibility of saving it. There are still one or two green leaves left, but before he can stop himself, he tips the pot into the trash can. The soil lands with an unsatisfying t h u m p, and hidden underneath are the dead stems and the dead leaves and the dead pot. He turns his back and moves towards the kitchen. The coffee brewer was a housewarming gift from his mother as well. He hasn’t thrown this one out yet, but then again, it had been showing signs of a struggle the day before. Ezra pours the grinds and boiling water in and hits the switch. It takes a moment, but eventually it begins to sputter out the steaming liquid. And so the coffee brewer stays.

<p class="a">His mother calls at 9:15 A.M. today. He ignores the incessant ringing, sipping his coffee slowly. When the cup is finally empty and the buzzing in his ears has long stopped, he picks up the cell phone to text her.
