    <p class="a"> Over my four years in ESP, I have drawn inspiration from different people. As a freshman, I sought to tell the stories of other people: to learn about humanity through the lens of fiction. As a sophomore, I explored the stories that I felt too often went untold, and focused on individually unique experiences. As a junior, I became more interested in relationships — with others, with your environment, with yourself. As a senior, I finally learned to draw the most power from my own voice.
<p class="a">
  My growth as a writer has not been linear. I’ve bounced around, sometimes even visiting the same story two, three times. But where I’ve ended up is at the center of it all, with a view of all the faces around me.
