    <h1><center><strong><em> Cold </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">I know she can’t be far behind me. I’d taken her by surprise when I up and left, especially when I kept going, out through the exit doors. Yes, she must be frantic.
    <p class="a">The wind feels good on my skin, catching on my outstretched fingers and flitting through each of my individual hairs. The dark strands quarrel with the air behind me, rushing like spilled ink.

    <p class="a">My legs are still trying to whisk me as far away from the school as possible. I leap off the sidewalk platform and hit the pavement of the parking lot. I close my eyes, just <em>feeling it all</em>. The hard soles of my shoes against the blacktop, crashing and rising, rising and crashing. The smell of this morning’s rain seeping into the golden leaves. The cries of the birds above and around me. But most of all, it’s the <em>cold</em>. It’s beating me, pouring into my skin and stripping away the warmth. It’s threatening this utter intoxication but at the same time it’s driving it because it’s real, <em>it’s finally cold</em>.
