    <h1><center><strong><em> Birds </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">On one shadowy afternoon, I received a phone call from a friend. “Come quick,” she whispered. “I think there’s a bird in my house.”
<p class="a">There was, actually, a bird in her house. When I arrived in front of her house, she and her sister stood figures in the garage door, reluctant to share a space with the bird. I stretched my hand towards them; they both caught me and pulled me in.
<p class="a"><em>Where is it?</em>
<p class="a">We slipped silent for a moment, straining our ears for the sound of a bird. <em>What does a bird sound like? </em>It coos, I suppose. But only if it’s speaking. <em>What if it’s not? </em>Then we listen for the sound of wings. It’s not quite the same, but what are birds without wings and wings without body? <em>Maybe they are the same.</em>
<p class="a">A flutter, a hop, a heartbeat.
<p class="a">We inched towards the noise together, three girls cowered together like gnats swaying in a swarm. Her arm touched mine, my fingers grasped hers, and she fit in between us. Was the sound even real? Or did we imagine it over the heat escaping our skin and catching our breaths. It doesn’t matter, I suppose.
<p class="a">She spotted the bird first. Its dotted tail feathers poked out from behind the piano.
<p class="a">We got closer. From there, it looked like it was thinking hard about something. <em>Do birds think? </em>Sure, doesn’t everyone? <em>What do birds think about? </em>Maybe nothing.
<p class="a">I did not stop to wonder what the bird was thinking about. I unlocked my fingers from hers and stretched them towards the bird. It did not move, but as I was looking at the hand, <em>my hand</em>, in front of my face, the bird suddenly seemed so much bigger. My palms perspired and rejoined their places in hers.
<p class="a">Three girls, leaning on each other and their bodies. Six hands, none of them large enough to find the bird. One bird, unable to speak and unable to think.
