    <p class="a">I take a final glance at the window, reassuring myself that he really isn’t here, she’s fine, before turning my back to the house. A cold breeze whistles through the air, lifting some of the leaves from their place on the lawn. They land on the pavement behind me and continue to scrape their way along.

    <p class="a"><em>Don’t look at her.</em> I can hear his wife humming a tune and the faint thumps as she paces. <em>Don’t. </em>
