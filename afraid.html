    <h1><center><strong><em> Afraid </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">Her laugh is hollow. “What don’t you understand? They kicked me out. Claire’s adopting a baby, they don’t want me anymore. I can’t go back to that house, and I’m not going back to my uncle’s. It’s my turn to move on. This is it, I’m ready.” She squeezes her eyes closed, expecting the world to fall away.

<p class="a">I snap her awake. “You’re not <em>ready</em>. Look at you, you’re scared.”
<p class="a">It’s true. Her hands fidget by her side; her eyes are shut tightly in apprehension. Her hands clench into white fists. “Why would I be scared? I should be glad to be getting away from this.”

	<p class="a">“Should be? Listen to yourself, Alice. You don’t want to <em>die</em>.”
<p class="a">At <em>die</em>, she opens her eyes. They are full of fear and desperation.

	<p class="a">Her whisper is barely audible.

<p class="a">“Then what am I supposed to do?”
