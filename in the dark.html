    <h1><center><strong><em> THREE TAPS </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">“Three taps means <em>I-LOVE-YOU</em>.”

<p class="a">Three taps could mean anything, really. <em>WHAT’S-YOUR-NAME. TO-GO-PLEASE. ONE-TWO-THREE. I-HATE-YOU.</em>

<p class="a">You say these words in the dark of your basement floor, and I am grasping for your voice and the warmth of your arm and just something to lean on, breathe on. We are buzzed on the late night and next week’s deadlines, but I am sober to your touch. <em>Three times. Is that really all it takes? </em>The black outline of your face is fuzzy in the 2 AM glow, and empty just in the places where I need to see you.

<p class="a">But you tap me three times and the familiar ache in the flesh of my stomach recedes. <em>I-LOVE-YOU</em>, I remind myself. I also remind myself of when you stroked my back as I cried over smoke and ashes. I flick through the pages in my memory where you are the first to tell me that I deserve love. I find the words you gave me on my birthday, the ones that gave me strength for another year today.

<p class="a">I still remember the juicy tissue of the tangerine you handed to me with sticky fingers. Last week, or maybe last month. The slice was sweet in my mouth and cold in my throat, and you made my fingers sticky too. But you peeled this tangerine, you dug your fingernail into its skin and ripped its fruits for me. I licked my fingers clean, and took another piece from you.

<p class="a">I learned later how much you love tangerines. How did you part so easily from them, even for me? The sacrificed slices sit sticky in my throat even now. It’s an unfamiliar feeling: not unwelcome, but not expected.

<p class="a">Now you sit on the floor while I sit on the couch behind you. My legs are tucked against each other, not touching the floor but maybe touching you. I can’t see you in the dark, but I can tell your eyes are still pointed at me and your hair is still sticking up in all the wrong places. I resist the urge to fix it.

<p class="a">I shut my eyes tightly, shuttering them against the sight of you and your tangerines and your words. But it is dark, and there’s not much of a difference anyway. I still feel the warmth of your arm and your <em>TAP-TAP-TAP</em>. A sticky feeling crawls into my stomach to replace the ache. I wonder if this is any better.

<em>I-LOVE-YOU</em>, I have to remind myself. <em>I-LOVE-YOU.</em>
