    <h1><center><strong><em> The Darkest Grape </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">Right about now, Jack is wishing he had an ice pop. It’s not quite summer yet, but he’s wishing it was. There’s more to look forward to, he thinks. There’s nothing in spring for him, he thinks.

<p class="a">He misses sticky fingers and colored tongues. Now he’s thinking about last summer, the one he spent with his grandmother in Wyoming. She <em>always</em> had ice pops for him. She only ever had grape, though. And it was <em>always</em> the darkest grape.

<p class="a">Then, Jack remembers his grandmother’s funeral. This was two weeks ago, he reminds himself. He stares at his hands, trying to picture an ice pop in them. But he can only taste it, the darkest grape, at the back of his throat. It’s more sour than he remembers.
