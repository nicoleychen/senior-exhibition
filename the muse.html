    <p class="a">Maybe, maybe I—
<p class="a">You are unsent letters. Sometimes she traces your name on steamed glass and watches it bleed. Sometimes she tells the sky it is cruel, the sun that it is useless. Sometimes she writes about you and pretends it is fiction.

<p class="a">You are today. You are also yesterday, and tomorrow. In fact, she won’t remember a time when it wasn’t you. She curses you under her breath for others to hear, and because she likes hearing your name out loud. It stops the ringing in her ears, at least for awhile. The wind batters the trees outside her window and the leaves yawn in response. Last night’s storm left worms wriggling on concrete.

<p class="a">When she walks to school, or to the supermarket, or takes the bus to work, she likes to think about what she would do if you passed her on the street right now. Would she stare? Would she turn the other way? She never finds out, because she never sees you. But she thinks about it anyway. She can hear the echoes of God laughing at her.

<p class="a">She decides that there isn’t a room in the world big enough to fit you both. There, in an unnamed city, the smell of rain and smoke reaches you. White streaks across dawn and breaks the sky into crooked pink fragments. She breathes out, and stops pretending.

<p class="a">Maybe it’s you. Maybe it’s me.
