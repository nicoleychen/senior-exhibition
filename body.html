    <h1><center><strong><em> Body </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">Drooping trees folded the street, surrounding the idyllic scene in greens and yellows and oranges. Leaves dusted the sidewalk and canvassed the road. A body lay in the center of it all, presented in the palm of the street below a nest stretching just above.

<p class="a">On her way home from her father’s funeral, she stepped off the curb, not caring to look down the street beforehand. She knew, somehow, that this was a one-way street. She’d certainly be able to hear a car coming from the other direction before it crashed into her.

<p class="a">So she stood on the street comfortably, examining the small bird laying in the middle of it. It was dead, she knew. Perhaps it hadn’t died immediately, because she could see no fatal injuries. There was a small amount of dried blood beneath its wings, but nothing more. Perhaps it had gasped for air until its chest had caved and patiently crushed its breath.

<p class="a">At least, that’s what she could see without touching it. She considered flipping it over to examine the stomach, but after a quick pause, she filed and dismissed the thought.

<p class="a">Pleased at her display of self control, she allowed herself a hiccup and took her camera out from her backpack. She uncapped the lens and focused its body onto the concrete scene in front of her. She clicked the aperture once to the left, and then twice to the right. <em>Click.</em>

<p class="a">She snapped the shot, a single shot, then stepped back from the bird in response to the sound of tires scraping gravel. The large car rolled past her smoothly, but the bird’s body was pounded into a bloody, feathery mess. Tiny bones crunched and snapped into each other, turning the bird into a blot in the road.
