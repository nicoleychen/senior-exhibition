    <p class="a">The hands of the clock tick forward. Its open face glares outwards, reminding me of every other time I’ve attempted to look away. It whispers robotically to me, and I have no choice but to listen to time.

<p class="a">Thin black arrows point to a plastic 12:06. Five hours ago, I had felt five hours less tired. Cheap coffee did the trick, but maybe tea would’ve been a better choice. I have a headache now. My temples pulse to the ticking of the clock. Rhythm, rhythm. I smell the coffee on my breath and it only makes the pounding worse.

<p class="a">Five hours ago, I had been sitting across a restaurant table from him. He twists a metal ring around his index finger as he talks and I watch his knuckles curl in both directions to accommodate. I imagine weaving my fingers with his, feeling the cool band on my skin. Napkins litter the table; our meal is almost over, and my time is almost up. I sneak a peek at his eyes one last time. They are brown and vivid and full of truth. He catches me staring and shyly smiles, reaching a hand across the table, maybe to meet mine. Maybe, because I never find out. My fingers lurch backward and he recoils and I freeze. Everything freezes, and I mourn regret but my body celebrates. We’ve done it, we’ve won again!

<p class="a">My eyelids were heavy when I clicked my door shut, and I had climbed into bed only to lie awake for two more hours and listen to the clock tick. I lift my hand above my face and close one eye, letting the ceiling light stream past my fingers and silhouette my hand black, everything else blinding white. What a waste. I choke on the air and sit up straight.

<p class="a">I wish for sleep, and I wish for the past. I imagine weaving my fingers with his again, and I imagine not flinching this time. He holds his palm against mine for several minutes, and his eyes are still full of truth. I spend the night dreaming of him instead of staring at the clock. It’s an impossible dream. I feel ugly and unclean, but my body feels safe. It remembers what I wished to forget a long time ago, and although I should be grateful, it is cursed. Maybe this headache will never go away. I shut my eyes tightly and I breathe. Coffee.

<p class="a">Has this clock always been a ticking clock? No, it used to be silent, never interrupting, never ticking. Didn’t it? Why now? Why, when my skull is pressing into itself and my chest is heaving? I do not want this incessant buzz in my ears and in my head. I do not need to be reminded of every second that passes. I can’t listen anymore. I open my eyes and grip the arms of my chair and push my body onto my feet. Swaying, unconsciously, I stumble forwards and reach for the clock—
