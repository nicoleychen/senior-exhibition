    <h1><center><strong><em> What Happens When a Word is on the Tip of Your Tongue </em></center></strong></h1>
    <p class="a">“It’s on the tip of my tongue,” you say.
<p class="a"><em>What are you trying to describe?</em>
<p class="a">The moon when it’s halfway between half and full? Nostalgia for a time you’ve never known? A butterfly’s shell when it’s not yet a butterfly? <em>Chrysanthemum</em>. “No, that’s not right.”

<p class="a">Your mind twists to reach the word. You knew it last Tuesday, when you were sitting in your bedroom folding laundry and thinking about your childhood. It came easily to you then, but now both the memory and the word sit in the past: blurry, uncommunicative.

<p class="a">“It’s sitting right there, on the edge of my mouth. No, that’s not right. How does the saying go?” <em>The tip, the tip of the… something.</em>
<p class="a">Words are words. Words can’t move, they don’t escape. They are written on paper somewhere, or stamped in a book, or inked onto skin. These things won’t change, even if you have to go back and read them again and again and again.

<p class="a">What is the word for when you wake up in someone else’s body? Or for the new container that looks exactly like your pajamas and your hands and your beating red heart, but isn’t? No one else will notice, but you know: your real self is two seconds behind, or maybe a centimeter sideways.

<p class="a">“Oh, nevermind. The word’s gone.”
<p class="a"><em>But has the word disappeared? Or have you?</em>
